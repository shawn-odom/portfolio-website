            <h2>Personal Statement:</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Shawn Odom, and I am currently an undergraduate student at Portland State University, majoring in Computer Science. 
                I have a strong passion for learning and a deep curiosity about technology, which drives my commitment to continuously expand my knowledge and skills 
                in the field of computer science. In addition to my studies, I am an active member of the Computer Action Team (CAT), a voluntary 
                IT service dedicated to supporting the students of the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science (MCECS) at PSU. Through this role, 
                I have gained valuable hands-on experience in providing technical support, troubleshooting, and assisting fellow students with their IT-related needs.
                As I continue to advance my education, I am currently seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my skills and contribute to a company while further developing my expertise. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my technical background, strong problem-solving abilities, and collaborative mindset to add value to your team. I am excited about the possibility of working in a dynamic and innovative environment where I can continue to grow as a professional and make a meaningful impact.
